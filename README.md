## My Task

I created a simple one-day calendar that the user can easily to see the present, current and upcoming time in three different colors. In addition, the user can put their schedule into the time block and save it permanently from thier local PC.Finally, they can clear all the records from the time table just click the button named Clear All on the top the this page.  

HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. and I use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
